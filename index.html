                This is the project that started it all. Although I had written
                small scripts here and there in the past, I began seriously
                delving into programming and honing my skills while working on
                this project. Throughout this project, I learned the
                fundamentals of object-oriented programming, app development,
                how to interact with APIs, backend development, debugging, basic
                design principles, and how to go "zero to one," and much, much
                more. While it's true that this project didn't make me the next
                Zuckerburg, this project will always have a special place in my
                heart because of the <b>hundreds</b> of hours I spent working on
                this project and the invaluable practical experience I gained
                along the way. Not bad for a high schooler ðŸ¤·.
                <br />
                <br />
                This was an app developed with Dart using the Flutter framework,
                a framework that allowed for cross-platform development using
                only one codebase. On the backend-side, it was powered by
                Google's Firebase (Cloud Firestore). The basic idea behind the
                app is that it allowed for anonymous communication between
                "communities" (not inspired, but similar to Yik-Yak).

                During high school, I was able to get an internship with the
                United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a software developer.
                During my time there, I built various programs that utilized
                machine learning that would be useful in identifying recaptured
                specimens based off images; these were useful when conducting
                population studies of certain species around the area. Along the
                way, I also learned new languages such as Python and R, and was
                happy to get my first taste of "professional" experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                After my internship ended, my boss offered me a
                <b>paid</b> contractor position for other projects he had at
                hand. One of the projects I worked on as a contractor was an app
                that would be used to capture duck pictures in a standarized
                way.
                <br />
                <br />
                This app was built using Dart with the Flutter framework to
                allow for cross-platform usage, with images being stored via
                Google's Cloud Storage. In this project, I achieved a
                significant advancement in both design and code quality; I
                developed more harmonious, robust, and responsive designs, while
                also producing code that is notably cleaner and more
                maintainable compared to my previous work.

                This project is from the first Hackathon that I joined, which
                was sponsored by Northrop Grumman. The challenge for the
                Hackathon was to build an application using a web scrapper, or
                create an application that utilized open vision. Together, with
                4 other friends, we decided to build a web scrapper application
                that scrapped Amazon reviews and utilized OpenAI's Da Vinci AI
                model to determine whether reviews were fraudulent or not.
                <br />
                <br />
                While our team did not win in this event, I still gained some
                valuable skills by participating in this event. In terms of
                technical skills, I learned how to use various web-scraping
                packages, such as BeautifulSoup. Additionally, I strengthened my
                frontend development skills. I also learned how to use Flask to
                create API endpoints in Python.
                <br />
                <br />
                In terms of soft skills, as team leader of the group, I
                organized meetings, learned to effectively facilitate
                conversations, and broke down objectives so our team could work
                efficiently. Being in the competition also taught me how to
                manage time with a tight deadline and present work in a clean
                and concise manner.

                The following project was from the Bitcamp Hackathon, one of the
                largest Hackathon events hosted at the Xfinity Center at the
                University of Maryland. Cumulatively, over 400 teams competed in
                a variety of categories. Together, with a friend, we developed a
                game called Guesser.ai. This game generated random AI images
                using OpenAI's Dall-E model, and users had to guess the prompt
                that generated the images. With this application, I was able to
                win in a Hackathon for the first time, winning the best
                gamfication hack award.
                <br />
                <br />
                The app was created using Swift's SwiftUI. The OpenAI API that
                generated AI images was accessed using Python, so Flask was used
                to create an endpoint for the Python script that could be called
                on Swift. The rest was all blood, sweat and tears, but
                fortunately, it all paid off.

                This is a project that I did for a capstone project for one of
                my university classes. The basic idea behind the app was to
                allow students to find study groups for their courses. For this
                project, I used Swift's SwiftUI for frontend development, and
                Firebase to store the various study groups and metadata related
                to users.
                <br />
                <br />
                With this project, I learned how to build apps with Apple's new
                SwiftUI framework. This project also allowed me to develop my
                UI/UX skills, with this being one of my most impressive projects
                in terms of UI design.

                This is a project that I am currently working on right now with
                a friend. In a nutshell, it's a specialized kick starter site
                for manga and other graphic novels.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although, I worked on all aspects of the projects, I mainly
                focused on frontend development. For this project, I used the
                React framework to build a modern and responsive site that looks
                beautiful on both desktop and mobile. Client-side and
                server-side logic was built using JavaScript and the backend
                utilizes PostgreSQL.
