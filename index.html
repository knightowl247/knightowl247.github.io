          Hi y'all! My name is William Huang and I currently attend the
          University of Maryland and will graduate this coming Spring. I am
          majoring in computer science and minoring in statistics.

                This is the project that started it all. Although I had written
                small scripts here and there in the past, I began seriously
                delving into programming and honing my skills while working on
                this project. Throughout this project, I learned the
                fundamentals of object-oriented programming, app development,
                how to interact with APIs, backend development, debugging, basic
                design principles, and how to go "zero to one," and much, much
                more. While it's true that this project didn't make me the next
                Zuckerburg, this project will always have a special place in my
                heart because of the <b>hundreds</b> of hours I spent working on
                this project and the invaluable practical experience I gained
                along the way. Not bad for a high schooler ðŸ¤·.
                <br />
                <br />
                This was an app developed with Dart using the Flutter framework,
                a framework that allowed for cross-platform development using
                only one codebase. On the backend-side, it was powered by
                Google's Firebase (Cloud Firestore). The basic idea behind the
                app is that it allowed for anonymous communication between
                "communities" (not inspired, but similar to Yik-Yak).

              <p>
                During high school, I was able to get an internship with the
                United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a software developer.
                During my time there, I built various programs that utilized
                machine learning that would be useful in identifying recaptured
                specimens based off images; these were useful when conducting
                population studies of certain species around the area. Along the
                way, I also learned new languages such as Python and R, and was
                happy to get my first taste of "professional" experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                After my internship ended, my boss offered me a
                <b>paid</b> contractor position for other projects he had at
                hand. One of the projects I worked on as a contractor was an app
                that would be used to capture duck pictures in a standarized
                way.
                <br />
                <br />
                This app was built using Dart with the Flutter framework to
                allow for cross-platform usage, with images being stored via
                Google's Cloud Storage. In this project, I achieved a
                significant advancement in both design and code quality; I
                developed more harmonious, robust, and responsive designs, while
                also producing code that is notably cleaner and more
                maintainable compared to my previous work.
